# Reddit Web Scraping Project

### This project retreives data specifically from the posts that the user has saved on Reddit from its API. I made a website which then displayed only the saved posts into a table and sort through each column when clicked upon each header.

If you want the highest score you just click on "score" and if you want to match the subreddit in ascending or descending order you just click on "Subreddit" as shown in the video.
