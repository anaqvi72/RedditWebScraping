# Reddit Web Scraping Project

## The main reason for this project was that the saved posts on the reddit website was always mixed with other subreddits.
## This project retreives data from the Reddit API and sorts through the column when clicked upon

If you want the highest score you just click on "score" and so on with other columns
or if you want to match the subreddit in ascending or descending order you just click on "Subreddit" as shown in the video.
